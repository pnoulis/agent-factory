## About

This repository hosts the **agent-factory** project.

The repository is split into **infrastructure** and **content**.

The infrastructure of the project is kept at the root level of the repository while

content under department subdirectories. Within the root level and each department

everything under cloud/ is ignored by this repository and instead synced to a

cloud-storage provider such as google-drive.

## Terminology

**Project**

    A Project represents a conceptual container used to refer to any activity
    individual or collaborative towards an intended goal. For example the
    agent-factory project encapsulates IE's group decision to build escape rooms
    for sale. The agent-factory project therefore refers to all activity
    related towards that aim.
    
**Department**

    A Department is an organizational unit representing different areas of
    responsibility. For example, large-enough project's may be owned by
    the software and sales department. The software department is responsible
    for developing software for the project while the sales department is
    responsible for selling it.
    
**Package**

    A Package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are
    compiled together.

**Module**

    A Module is a collection of packages that are treated as a single unit.
